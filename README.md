# JS-Password-Generator
## Homework 3
A webpage that prompts a series of questions and generates a password for the user. 

## Motivation
Everyone needs a random strong password.

## How it works
Once the generate password button is clicked a function starts that prompts the user. The page asks how many characters should be in the password as well as what type of characters the password should contain. The function then checks answers and adds the appropiate character strings to an empty string that will hold all characters allowed. The characters are then randomly chosen and put in order with a for loop.
